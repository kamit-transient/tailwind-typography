# tailwind-typography

This css style uses `TailwindCss` styling to style basic typography element. If you want to use it just copy and paste. Please make sure
you paste this *before* `@tailwind utilities;` and after `@tailwind base; and @tailwind components;` so that when you override the
styles somewhere in your component/files it works without using `!important` thing.



Will be improving this code override. Feel free to use it.
